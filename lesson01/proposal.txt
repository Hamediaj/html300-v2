For this course project I will be building a site about Seattle. I will include places to eat, sights to see and actives that can be done. The reason I want to focus my project on Seattle is because Seattle is a popular tourist destination. Since I was born and raised in Seattle I want to point out some of the places I believe are worth visiting. 

I plan to build this website similar to what a blog site would look like. I’ll have four pages that will include: 

* About Seattle
* Restaurants (include popular brunch and dinner options)
* Drinks/Desserts (Tea spots, donut shop, cake shop - deep sea sugar)
* Sights & Activities (pike place, space needle, gas work parks, underground seattle - hiking locations)

Seattle has many popular destinations. These pages will have a quick overview of some of the places I think is worth visiting. 

Seattle is known to be the rainy city but when the sun is out, the weather is perfect. For this reason I am planning to incorporate some type of weather API. I would also like to include directions/map location using an API.
